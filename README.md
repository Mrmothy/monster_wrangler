### About the game making experience:

This was a project I put together to gain some of the fundamentals of how Pygame mechanics work using
with Python. This was my first project with using Python Classes and how to use Pygame Sprites. This 
was an awesome project to work on as it allowed me to learn how to ingrate Classes in to my Pygame.
This project also taught me how to create a game class to deal with collision detection and you adding
a pause game screen feature. I am excited for my next project!

### Image, Music and Design Shout-outs:

The game loop design was used from a UDEMY corse lead by Michael Eramo. This gme design is based
off a game he created call Feed The Dragon and can be found in his corse call:
The Art of Doing: Video Game Creation With Python and Pygame
